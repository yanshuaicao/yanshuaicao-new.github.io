I build AI products that generate value and do fundamental research.

At RBC Borealis, I run teams that build AI solutions and am responsible for the profit they generate. My job is simple: 1) find ways AI can create or optimize value, 2) scale the team, tech, and business to make it happen.

Most of my product work is confidential, so this site focuses on research and projects that I can share.
