I build AI products that generate value for others, and conduct fundamental research and write classical style Chinese poems as creative outlets for myself.

At RBC Borealis, my job is "simple": 1) find ways AI can create or optimize value, 2) scale teams, technology, and business to make it happen.

Most of my product work is confidential, so this site focuses on research and projects that I can share, and my [poems](/poetry/).
