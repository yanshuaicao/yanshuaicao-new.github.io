I build AI-powered value-generating products and also conduct and publish fundamental research. 

In my current role at RBC Borealis, I lead an organization of teams and am accountable for the profit generated by its portfolio of AI solutions.

Most of my product work cannot be disclosed, so this site focuses on research and other projects that I can share.
