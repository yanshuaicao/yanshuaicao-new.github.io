      abstract={The ability of zero-shot translation emerges when we train a multilingual model with certain translation directions; the model can then directly translate in unseen directions. Alternatively, zero-shot translation can be accomplished by pivoting through a third language (e.g., English). In our work, we observe that both direct and pivot translations are noisy and achieve less satisfactory performance. We propose EBBS, an ensemble method with a novel bi-level beam search algorithm, where each ensemble component explores its own prediction step by step at the lower level but they are synchronized by a "soft voting" mechanism at the upper level. Results on two popular multilingual translation datasets show that EBBS consistently outperforms direct and pivot translations as well as existing ensemble techniques. Further, we can distill the ensemble's knowledge back to the multilingual model to improve inference efficiency; profoundly, our EBBS-based distillation does not sacrifice, or even improves, the translation quality.},

Although applying techniques like quantization can alleviate the constraint, they suffer from performance degradation. In this work, we introduce NeuZip, a new weight compression scheme based on the entropy of floating-point numbers in neural networks. With NeuZip, we are able to achieve memory-efficient training and inference without sacrificing performance. Notably, we significantly reduce the memory footprint of training a Llama-3 8B model from 31GB to less than 16GB, while keeping the training dynamics fully unchanged. In inference, our method can reduce memory usage by more than half while maintaining near-lossless performance. Our code is publicly available.},

      abstract={Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language tasks, but they often struggle with planning problems that require structured reasoning. To address this limitation, the conversion of planning problems into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) has been proposed as a potential solution, enabling the use of automated planners. However, generating accurate PDDL files typically demands human inputs or correction, which can be time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages LLMs and environment feedback to automatically generate PDDL domain and problem description files without the need for human intervention. Our method introduces an iterative refinement process that generates multiple problem PDDL candidates and progressively refines the domain PDDL based on feedback obtained from interacting with the environment. To guide the refinement process, we develop an Exploration Walk (EW) metric, which provides rich feedback signals for LLMs to update the PDDL file. We evaluate our approach on 
 PDDL environments. We achieve an average task solve rate of 66% compared to a 29% solve rate by GPT-4's intrinsic planning with chain-of-thought prompting. Our work enables the automated modeling of planning environments using LLMs and environment feedback, eliminating the need for human intervention in the PDDL translation process and paving the way for more reliable LLM agents in challenging problems.

While existing work directly probes for a complete state of the world, our research explores whether and how LLMs abstract this world state in their internal representations. We propose a new framework for probing for world representations through the lens of state abstraction theory from reinforcement learning, which emphasizes different levels of abstraction, distinguishing between general abstractions that facilitate predicting future states and goal-oriented abstractions that guide the subsequent actions to accomplish tasks. To instantiate this framework, we design a text-based planning task, where an LLM acts as an agent in an environment and interacts with objects in containers to achieve a specified goal state. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning as well as advanced pre-training strengthens LLM-built representations' tendency of maintaining goal-oriented abstractions during decoding, prioritizing task completion over recovery of the world's state and dynamics.},

We propose an initialization algorithm for contextual bandits by prompting LLMs to produce a pre-training dataset of approximate human preferences for the bandit. This significantly reduces online learning regret and data-gathering costs for training such models.

To alleviate this, the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is proposed to reduce the optimization states by training fewer parameters. However, LoRA restricts overall weight update matrices to be low-rank, limiting the model performance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of LoRA and identify that it can be approximated by a random projection. Based on this observation, we propose Flora, which is able to achieve high-rank updates by resampling the projection matrices while enjoying the sublinear space complexity of optimization states. We conduct experiments across different tasks and model architectures to verify the effectiveness of our approach.",

To this end, we propose a notion of "tree averaging," based on which we further propose a novel ensemble method for unsupervised parsing. To improve inference efficiency, we further distill the ensemble knowledge into a student model; such an ensemble-then-distill process is an effective approach to mitigate the over-smoothing problem existing in common multi-teacher distilling methods. Experiments show that our method surpasses all previous approaches, consistently demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across various runs, with different ensemble components, and under domain-shift conditions.}

Moreover, even the questions pertinent to a given domain, which are the input of a semantic parsing system, might not be readily available, especially in cross-domain semantic parsing. This makes data augmentation even more challenging. Existing methods to synthesize new data use hand-crafted or induced rules, requiring substantial engineering effort and linguistic expertise to achieve good coverage and precision, which limits the scalability. In this work, we propose a purely neural approach of data augmentation for semantic parsing that completely removes the need for grammar engineering while achieving higher semantic parsing accuracy. Furthermore, our method can synthesize in the zero-shot setting, where only a new domain schema is available without any input-output examples of the new domain. On the Spider cross-domain text-to-SQL semantic parsing benchmark, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the development set (77.2% accuracy) using our zero-shot augmentation.",

This work shows that this does not always need to be the case: with proper initialization and optimization, the benefits of very deep transformers can carry over to challenging tasks with small datasets, including Text-to-SQL semantic parsing and logical reading comprehension. In particular, we successfully train 48 layers of transformers, comprising 24 fine-tuned layers from pre-trained RoBERTa and 24 relation-aware layers trained from scratch. With fewer training steps and no task-specific pre-training, we obtain the state of the art performance on the challenging cross-domain Text-to-SQL parsing benchmark Spider.

In this work, we propose to use rate distortion (RD) curves to evaluate and compare deep generative models. While estimating RD curves is seemingly even more computationally demanding than log-likelihood estimation, we show that we can approximate the entire RD curve using nearly the same computations as were previously used to achieve a single log-likelihood estimate. We evaluate lossy compression rates of VAEs, GANs, and adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Measuring the entire RD curve gives a more complete picture than scalar-valued metrics, and we arrive at a number of insights not obtainable from log-likelihoods alone.},

In this work, we find that sequence VAEs trained on text fail to properly decode when the latent codes are manipulated, because the modified codes often land in holes or vacant regions in the aggregated posterior latent space, where the decoding network fails to generalize. Both as a validation of the explanation and as a fix to the problem, we propose to constrain the posterior mean to a learned probability simplex, and performs manipulation within this simplex. Our proposed method mitigates the latent vacancy problem and achieves the first success in unsupervised learning of controllable representations for text.

The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on a range of synthetic and real-world sequential data that exhibit large scale variations, regime shifts, and complex dynamics.},

      year={2019},
      abstract={Variational autoencoders (VAEs) hold great potential for modelling text, as they could in theory separate high-level semantic and syntactic properties from local regularities of natural language. Practically, however, VAEs with autoregressive decoders often suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon where the model learns to ignore the latent variables, causing the sequence VAE to degenerate into a language model. In this paper, we argue that posterior collapse is in part caused by the lack of dispersion in encoder features. We provide empirical evidence to verify this hypothesis, and propose a straightforward fix using pooling. This simple technique effectively prevents posterior collapse, allowing model to achieve significantly better data log-likelihood than standard sequence VAEs. Comparing to existing work, our proposed method is able to achieve comparable or superior performances while being more computationally efficient.},

One important limitation of existing coherence models is that training on one domain does not easily generalize to unseen categories of text. Previous work advocates for generative models for cross-domain generalization, because for discriminative models, the space of incoherent sentence orderings to discriminate against during training is prohibitively large. In this work, we propose a local discriminative neural model with a much smaller negative sampling space that can efficiently learn against incorrect orderings. The proposed coherence model is simple in structure, yet it significantly outperforms previous state-of-art methods on a standard benchmark dataset on the Wall Street Journal corpus, as well as in multiple new challenging settings of transfer to unseen categories of discourse on Wikipedia articles.},

Such failure hinders the application of deep learning based vision system in continual learning settings. In this work, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective way of preventing catastrophic forgetting. Our method, called Few-shot Self Reminder (FSR), regularizes the neural net from changing its learned behaviour by performing logit matching on selected samples kept in episodic memory from the old tasks. Surprisingly, this simplistic approach only requires to retrain a small amount of data in order to outperform previous methods in knowledge retention.

Further, hard negative mining has been shown effective in forcing models to learn discriminaitve features for accurate retrieval. In this paper, we present a new technique for hard negative mining for learning visual-semantic embeddings, with an adversary that is learned in a min-max game with the cross-modal embedding model. The adversary exploits compositionality of images and texts and is able to compose harder negatives through novel combination of objects and regions across different images for a given caption. We find that our approach leads to higher scores across-the-board for all R@K based metrics over the previous state of the art.},

These in turn help G to explore better and discover the real data manifold while avoiding large unstable jumps due to the erroneous extrapolation made by D. Our regularizer guides the rectifier discriminator D to better allocate its model capacity, by encouraging the binary activation patterns on selected internal layers of D to have a high joint entropy. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate improvements in stability and convergence speed of the GAN training, as well as higher sample quality. The approach also leads to higher classification accuracies in semi-supervised learning.},

Standard evaluation metrics have shown their remarkable speedup and prediction accuracy in test time, but their adversarial robustness remains unexplored even though it is an important security feature in deployment. We study the robustness of pruned neural networks under adversarial
attacks. We discover that although pruned models maintain the original accuracy,
they are more vulnerable to such attacks. We further show that adversarial training improves the robustness of pruned networks. However, it is observed there
exist trade-offs among compression rate, accuracy and robustness in adversarially trained pruned neural networks. Our analysis suggests that we should pay
additional attention to robustness in neural network pruning rather than just maintaining the classification accuracy.}

The resulting adaptive sampler finds harder negative examples, which forces the main model to learn a better representation of the data. We evaluate our proposal on learning word embeddings, order embeddings and knowledge graph embeddings and observe both faster convergence and improved results on multiple metrics.",

We propose a model selection objective for t-SNE perplexity that requires negligible extra computation beyond that of the t-SNE itself. We empirically validate that the perplexity settings found by our approach are consistent with preferences elicited from human experts across a number of datasets.

Previous methods for generating adversarial images focused on image perturbations designed to produce erroneous class labels. Here we instead concentrate on the internal layers of DNN representations, to produce a new class of adversarial images that differs qualitatively from others. While the adversary is perceptually similar to one image, its internal representation appears remarkably similar to a different image, from a different class and
bearing little if any apparent similarity to the input. Further, they appear generic
and consistent with the space of natural images. This phenomenon demonstrates
the possibility to trick a DNN to confound almost any image with any other chosen
image, and raises questions about DNN representations, as well as the properties
of natural images themselves.},
